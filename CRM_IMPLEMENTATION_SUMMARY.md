# CKC-SHRMS Comprehensive CRM System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of a comprehensive CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system for the CKC-SHRMS (School Health Records Management System). The system provides specialized functionality for both patients and doctors.

## System Architecture

### User Types & Access Levels
1. **Students (user_type = 1)**: Limited access to personal health records and appointments
2. **Faculty & Staff (user_type = 2)**: Limited access similar to students (no longer auto-admin)
3. **Doctors (user_type = 3)**: Full CRM access with practice management tools

### Authentication Guards
- **Web Guard**: For regular users (Students, Faculty & Staff, Doctors)
- **Admin Guard**: For system administrators
