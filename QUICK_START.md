# Quick Start - Manual Database Setup

Since PHP and Composer need to be installed first, here's what you need to know about your project:

## Project Analysis ✅

Your CTC Clinic Record System is:
- **Laravel 11** web application
- **Already configured for SQLite** (no changes needed)
- **Complete clinic management system** with patients, doctors, appointments, medical records

## Database Schema Overview

The system includes these main components:
- **Users**: Admin, doctors, staff, students with role-based access
- **Patients**: Student and faculty patient records
- **Appointments**: Scheduling system
- **Health Records**: Medical history tracking  
- **Examinations**: Physical and dental exam records
- **Immunizations**: Vaccination tracking
- **Prescriptions**: Medication records
- **Reports**: Medical reporting system

## Test Accounts (After Setup)

The system will create these default accounts:
- **Admin**: admin@ckc.edu / password123
- **Doctor**: doctor@ckc.edu / password123  
- **Staff**: staff@ckc.edu / password123
- **Student**: student@ckc.edu / password123

## Next Steps

1. **Install Prerequisites**:
   - PHP 8.2+ (https://windows.php.net/download/)
   - Composer (https://getcomposer.org/download/)
   - Node.js (optional, for frontend)

2. **Run Setup**:
   ```bash
   # After installing PHP and Composer
   composer install
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed
   php artisan serve
   ```

3. **Access Application**:
   - URL: http://localhost:8000
   - Login with any test account above

## Database File Location

After setup, your SQLite database will be at:
`database/database.sqlite`

You can view/edit it with tools like:
- DB Browser for SQLite
- phpMyAdmin (with SQLite support)
- VS Code SQLite extensions

## Project Features
